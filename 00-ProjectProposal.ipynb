    "   1. For the variables, we need exact time-framed snapshots(enrollment_start_time), such as the enrollment data every 15 minutes once the enrollment opens, the predictors, like the rate of seats filled per minute, using (enrolled_count), (waitlist_count), and (total_seats_available). The target variable is (max_waitlist_size), and some other categorical variables like (course_subject), (course_level), (rmp_quality_score) or (course_time).\n",
    "   2. We would need MATH and COGS data at least for the past 3 academic years(excluding graduate only data and summer sessions), or approximately 9 quarters to account for different behaviors between seasons. This would approximately be 5000 course selections.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [x] **A.1 Informed consent**: In this project, an existing publicly available dataset containing aggregated data for course enrollments at UCSD is used. There is no direct interaction with human subjects, so informed consent is not applicable.\n",
    "- [x] **A.2 Collection bias**: We are also aware of potential biases that are related to course types, departments, terms, and enrollment policies, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Thus, we are focusing on the COGS (cognitive science) department.\n",
    "- [x] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: The data does not contain personally identifiable information and is aggregated at the course level, so there are no privacy risks. The analysis does not increase the exposure of the data.\n",
    "- [x] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: The dataset lacks protected attributes, and as such, it is difficult for us to determine the differential effects on different student groups. We will interpret the results cautiously and avoid making prescriptive claims that could create unintended bias in course planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    "  - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > There is a risk that the model could pick up on student biases against instructors of certain genders, ethnicities, or backgrounds by the instructor column, like predicting lower waitlists for female instructors in STEM fields. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > The model may perform unevenly across different subjects, defined by the (subj_course_id). It might be highly accurate for large, predictable majors like CSE or Biology, but fail for smaller departments where waitlist behavior is erratic, resulting in higher error rates for students in smaller majors. We could evaluate the mean absolute error separately for different departments.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Our current metric is accuracy, but this might not leave the room for underestimates, since it might cause students to not get into classes. So, we should consider a metric that avoids underestimation more than overestimation, as it is the worse outcome for the students.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Our approach is to prioritize interpretable insights for students, so if the model predicts a massive waitlist, we should be able to explain why, like \"This course filled 50% of its (total_seats) in the first 10 minutes, which historically leads to a high waitlist.\"\n",
    "\n",
    " - [x] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Our plan is to clearly state that this model is a prediction, and not a guarantee by specifying that the dataset cannot account for sudden administrative changes, like sudden 20 seats openings in Week 2. We would explicitely state these limitations to the stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "    > If the analysis leads to misleading or biased conclusions that negatively affect course planning, the analysis should be re-examined and revised. This may include adjusting assumptions, incorporating additional variables, or clearly communicating uncertainty to prevent repeated harm.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "    > If the predictive relationship no longer holds or produces unreliable results, the use of this analysis should be paused or discontinued until it is revalidated. Rolling back to alternative or descriptive approaches would help avoid reinforcing incorrect decisions.\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "    > The results of this project may be misused if interpreted as measures of course quality or instructor performance. To reduce this risk the intended scope and limitations of the analysis should be clearly stated, emphasizing that it is meant for aggregate-level planning rather than individual evaluation."
